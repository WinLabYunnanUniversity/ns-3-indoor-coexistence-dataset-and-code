## ns-3-indoor-coexistence-dataset-and-code
The dataset is emulated by the LBT Wi-Fi Coexistence Module in ns-3, and the data is divided into three traffic applications: ftp, voice flows, and constant bitrate flows. The python file under the subfile is part of the code for the machine learning model, and there is a strong learning chemistry interacting with ns-3 that requires the installation of ns-3 and ns3-ai, and the code must interface with python under the ns-3 terminal for reinforcement learning to run.
